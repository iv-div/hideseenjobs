# hideseenjobs
a chrome extension to hide previously seen jobs on jobboards.
**What it does**
The extension has two buttons. The first button writes the unique identifications of all the job postings visible on the page into a table. 
The second button hides all jobs that are in the table. 
If the site has multiple pages, the button will work only with the current page.
